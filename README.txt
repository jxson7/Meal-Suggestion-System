** READ ME **

All the required files for Assignment III of CS1812 are available and 
can be found in this folder. The main program can be accessed via the 
file titled "DinnerSuggest.java". Unfortunately, I was unable to apply
the loading functionality, however, the saving functionality successfully
works and data can be saved to suggest.txt. 

Thanks,

Jason Jay Dookarun
